## User Management CRUD Application

React | TypeScript | Vite

## Project Overview

This project is a User Management CRUD application developed using React, TypeScript, and Vite.

The application allows users to:

Create new users

View user details

Edit existing users

Delete users

The code follows a parent–child component architecture, keeping App.tsx lightweight and separating business logic for better maintainability.

## Live Demo

## Deployed using Vercel
## (https://curd-react-liart.vercel.app/)

## Tech Stack

 React

 TypeScript

 Vite

 Material UI (MUI)

 React Hook Form

 React Toastify

 JSON Server (Mock API)

 Vercel (Deployment)

## Features
## User CRUD Operations

Create user

View users

Edit user details

Delete user

## Form Validation

Required field checks

Email format validation

Phone number must be 10 digits

Character length validation

Inline error messages

## Duplicate Validation

Prevents duplicate entries for:

Email

Phone number

First name

Errors are shown using toast notifications.

## User Table

Serial number column

Pagination (5 / 10 rows)

Edit & delete actions

Empty state message when no data is available

## Notifications

Success and error messages using React Toastify

## Architecture & Design

Minimal logic inside App.tsx

Business logic handled using custom hooks

UI split into reusable components

Clear separation of concerns

This design helps in easy scaling and future enhancements.

## Local Setup Instructions
## Clone the Repository
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd user-management-app

## Install Dependencies
npm install

## Start Mock Backend
npx json-server --watch db.json --port 3001


Sample db.json:

{
  "users": []
}

## Run the Application
npm run dev

## Deployment (Vercel)

The application is deployed using Vercel.

## Deployment Steps

Push code to GitHub

Import repository in Vercel

Use the following settings:

Build Command

npm run build

## Backend & Data Handling Note

This project is intended as a frontend-focused assignment.

A mock backend (JSON Server) is used only for local development to simulate API behavior.

No backend is deployed as part of this project.

The goal is to demonstrate:

UI design

Component architecture

State management

Form validation

CRUD flow handling on the frontend

During deployment:

The application runs as a static frontend.

API calls are expected to be connected to a real backend in a production environment.

This approach keeps the scope aligned with a frontend developer task and allows easy integration with any backend in the future.

## Local Development (Mock API)

For local testing only:

npx json-server --watch db.json --port 3001


Sample db.json:

{
  "users": []
}

## Deployment

Frontend is deployed using Vercel

Backend services are intentionally excluded

This is by design for frontend evaluation purposes

## Mock Data Support (No Backend Required)

If the backend API is unavailable or not configured, the application
automatically falls back to a frontend mock data store.

- CRUD operations work fully without an API
- Data is persisted using browser localStorage
- No code changes are required in UI components

This allows the application to function as a complete frontend-only solution
while remaining backend-ready.
